DESCRIPTION

This project explores the trends of obesity, overweight, and Salt Intake in Nigeria.

Using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), I examined: 

Obesity & overweight prevalence among adults 18+

Average salt intake

 Gender differences in Average salt intake and Obesity & overweight prevalence among adults 18+. 

The dataset was obtained from the WHO NCD Data Portal.

INTRODUCTION

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are now the leading causes of death worldwide, and Nigeria is no exception. Among the strongest lifestyle-related risk factors are obesity, overweight, and unhealthy diets.

Obesity & Overweight: Excess body weight increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers. In Nigeria, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has been steadily rising, it is a worrying trend for the nation’s future health.

Salt Intake: High sodium consumption is one of the major dietary risk factors for hypertension and CVD. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily intake of ≤5 grams of salt, yet global data shows that average intake is often much higher, including in Nigeria.

Together, these risk factors directly fuel the burden of NCDs. Understanding their patterns over time is critical for designing effective prevention strategies, awareness campaigns, and health policies

AIM

The aim of this project is to explore lifestyle-related risk factors that drive the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Nigeria, with a particular focus on obesity, overweight, and salt intake.
Through descriptive analysis and visualization, the project seeks to:

Track national trends in obesity and overweight among adults (18+).

Highlight gender differences, showing how men and women are differently affected by obesity and overweight.

Examine dietary risks by analyzing mean salt intake among Nigerian adults (25+).

The visualizations generated including trends over time, gender comparisons, and dietary intake patterns serves as an accessible way to understand the scale of the problem.

OVERVIEW

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are becoming major public health concerns in Nigeria. Lifestyle-related risk factors, especially unhealthy diet, high salt consumption, and increasing rates of overweight/obesity, are fueling this trend.

This project explores how these risks have evolved in Nigeria over time. Using data from the WHO NCD Data Portal , the analysis highlights:

Trends in obesity and overweight among adults (18+), with attention to gender differences.

Average salt intake among adults (25+), broken down by sex.

The findings are presented through clear visualizations to help illustrate how lifestyle risk factors for NCDs are changing over time in Nigeria.

PROCESSES

To explore obesity, overweight, and salt intake trends in Nigeria, I followed these steps:

Data Collection

Pulled publicly available data from the WHO NCD Data Portal

Focused on indicators related to:

Obesity and overweight (adults 18+)

Mean salt intake (adults 25+)

Data Cleaning

Removed empty and irrelevant columns to this project (e.g., cancer type, country name, region, etc).

Converted year values to proper numeric format.

Filtered the dataset to focus only on the indicators of interest.


Exploratory Analysis (EDA)

Calculated yearly averages for obesity, overweight, and salt intake.

Looked at gender differences, especially for obesity/overweight.

Compared salt intake levels across men and women.

Visualization

Created line charts to show trends in obesity and overweight among adults.

Created line charts to highlight gender differences in obesity/overweight.

Plotted salt intake by year and gender to track changes over time.
Interpretation

Drew insights from the graphs to understand how lifestyle risk factors are shifting in Nigeria.

Highlighted what this means for public health awareness and policy.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES

To explore and analyze the data, I used a mix of tools that made the process smooth:

Python: my main programming language for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

Pandas: for handling and transforming the dataset (filtering, grouping, summarizing).

Matplotlib & Seaborn: to create clear and insightful charts that show trends and gender differences.

Jupyter Notebook: for running step-by-step analysis, documenting my thought process, and visualizing results interactively.

GitHub: to keep the project organized and share my work openly with others.

FINDINGS & INSIGHTS

Salt Intake in Adults (25+)

Both men and women in Nigeria consistently consumed more than 6 g/day of salt, which is above the WHO recommendation of ≤5 g/day.

Men showed slightly higher intake than women across all years.

There was a dip in salt intake in the early 2000s, but levels quickly rebounded and have since remained high, suggesting persistent dietary risks.
Trends in Obesity and Overweight (Adults 18+)

From 2000 to 2022, overweight prevalence steadily increased from about 20% to 34%.

Obesity also rose during this period, from around 5% to over 11%.

The upward slope shows that weight-related risks are worsening, with obesity doubling in just two decades.
Gender Differences in Obesity & Overweight

Women consistently recorded higher levels of both overweight and obesity compared to men.

In 2022, nearly 40% of women were overweight versus 28% of men, while obesity among women exceeded 15%, roughly double the male rate.

These gender gaps highlight sociocultural and biological differences, such as dietary patterns, physical activity, and possibly health-seeking behavior.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Reduce Salt Consumption

Launch nationwide campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of excess salt.

Encourage food industries to reformulate products with less salt, especially instant noodles, bread, and snacks which are widely consumed.

Promote clearer nutrition labeling so consumers can make healthier choices.

Tackle Rising Obesity and Overweight

Invest in community-based lifestyle programs that promote physical activity and balanced diets.

Integrate weight management into primary healthcare services, ensuring adults are screened and counseled early.

Partner with schools and workplaces to encourage structured exercise and healthier meal options.

Address Gender Differences

Design gender-sensitive interventions, as women face a higher burden of overweight and obesity.

Tailor communication campaigns to women, focusing on maternal health, nutrition education, and empowerment.

Engage men as allies in creating supportive home environments for healthier eating and activity.

Strengthen Policy and Monitoring

Enforce policies limiting trans fats and sugary drinks, while incentivizing fruit and vegetable consumption.

Support routine national surveys on diet and NCD risk factors to track progress over time.

Collaborate with regional and international partners to align with WHO NCD reduction targets.

CONCLUSION
Nigeria is facing a growing challenge from lifestyle-related health risks. Salt intake among adults remains consistently above safe levels, and the steady rise in obesity and overweight signals a looming burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Women, in particular, bear a disproportionate share of this burden, pointing to the need for targeted interventions.
While the trends are concerning, they also highlight an opportunity. By promoting healthier diets, encouraging physical activity, and strengthening national policies, Nigeria can bend the curve and prevent a major health crisis in the coming decades. The evidence is clear taking action now is more cost-effective and impactful than treating NCDs later.
